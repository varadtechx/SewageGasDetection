# SewageGasDetection
This Project is based on Detecting Sewage gas and Sending an alert on your phone via Wifi NodeMCU on a web app and also the LCD display Using an Arduino Uno and Buzzer system. 
Sewage management is an important aspect of municipal infrastructure and undoubtedly, it affects our daily hygiene. 
Poor sewage/drainage management can cause urban floods which are most common in crowded cities. 
This problem can be addressed by using Smart Sewage Management Device based on IoT and Sensor Technology. 
The underground environment of the sewage system is quite risky and unpleasant. 
Drainage cleaning people are not aware of the risk of a sudden attack of poisonous gas since the gasses are odourless if exposed for a long time which may cause serious health problems. 
Due to the lack of using a proper gas leakage detection system,  a  number of dangerous accidents occurred during the last few decades. 
To overcome all these problems an effective monitoring system is needed in the drainage channels.
 Here we design an IoT-based Smart Safety Monitoring System for Sewage Workers that comprises gas sensors 
 like  Carbon  Monoxide sensors,  Hydrogen Sulphide and Ammonia  sensors, and Methane sensors. 
 The proposed system shows an indication in the LCD Display if it detects the presence of highly toxic gasses beyond the threshold level and the buzzer is buzzed at the warning indication. 
 The system also shows the ppm value and the warning alarm on the mobile and other devices connected together via IoT.
